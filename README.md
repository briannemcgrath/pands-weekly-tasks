#Weekly Task 3: 
Used this website https://thispointer.com/replace-first-n-characters-from-a-string-in-python/ to replace the first n characters with X. Alternative solution I had was simply printing: 
print ("XXXXXX" + account_number[-4:]) 
This wasn't very efficient.. still searching on a solution for when the the number is larger than 10, withouth having to manually update the number of X's in the code. 

#Weekly Task 4:  
Simple loop created using information from lecture slides and labs. Have previously worked with loops from a previous diploma so used past knowledge to help with this task. 

Weekly Task 5: 
Used: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp to learn about the module datetime. Using datetime.now() to retrieve today's date and determine whether or not it is a weekday or weekend. 

Weekly Task 6: 
Researched Newton's Method of estimation using: https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/MoreAboutIteration/NewtonsMethod.html (this is what I based my formula on) and https://www.toppr.com/guides/python-guide/references/methods-and-functions/python-abs/#:~:text=Python%20abs()%20built%2Din,then%20it%20returns%20its%20magnitude. to use the built-in function to return an absolute value of a numeric value as an argument to the function. Used: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_break.asp to add in break in the while loop.
