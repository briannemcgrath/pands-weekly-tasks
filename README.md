#Weekly Task 3: 
11/02/24
Used this website https://thispointer.com/replace-first-n-characters-from-a-string-in-python/ to replace the first n characters with X. Alternative solution I had was simply printing: 
print ("XXXXXX" + account_number[-4:]) 
This wasn't very efficient.. still searching on a solution for when the the number is larger than 10, withouth having to manually update the number of X's in the code. 

#Weekly Task 4:  
02/03/2024
Simple loop created using information from lecture slides and labs. Have previously worked with loops from a previous diploma so used past knowledge to help with this task. 

Weekly Task 5: 
02/03/2024
Used this website https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp to learn about the module datetime. Using datetime.now() to retrieve today's date and determine whether or not it is a weekday or weekend.
