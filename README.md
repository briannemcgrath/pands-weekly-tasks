#Weekly Task 3: 
11/02/24
Used this website https://thispointer.com/replace-first-n-characters-from-a-string-in-python/ to replace the first n characters with X. Alternative solution I had was simply printing: 
print ("XXXXXX" + account_number[-4:]) 
This wasn't very efficient.. still searching on a solution for when the the number is larger than 10, withouth having to manually update the number of X's in the code.
